              >Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by
              British author J. K. Rowling. The novels chronicle the lives of a
              young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and
              Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of
              Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc concerns Harry's
              struggle against Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to
              become immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body known as the
              Ministry of Magic and subjugate all wizards and Muggles
              (non-magical people). The series was originally published in
              English by Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom and Scholastic Press
              in the United States. All versions around the world are printed by
              Grafica Veneta in Italy.[1] A series of many genres, including
              fantasy, drama, coming-of-age fiction, and the British school
              story (which includes elements of mystery, thriller, adventure,
              horror, and romance), the world of Harry Potter explores numerous
              themes and includes many cultural meanings and references.[2]
              According to Rowling, the main theme is death.[3] Other major
              themes in the series include prejudice, corruption, and
              madness.[4] Since the release of the first novel, Harry Potter and
              the Philosopher's Stone, on 26 June 1997, the books have found
              immense popularity, positive reviews, and commercial success
              worldwide. They have attracted a wide adult audience as well as
              younger readers and are often considered cornerstones of modern
              young adult literature.[5] As of February 2018, the books have
              sold more than 500 million copies worldwide, making them the
              best-selling book series in history, and have been translated into
              more than eighty languages.[6] The last four books consecutively
              set records as the fastest-selling books in history, with the
              final instalment selling roughly 2.7 million copies in the United
              Kingdom and 8.3 million copies in the United States within
              twenty-four hours of its release. The original seven books were
              adapted into an eight-part namesake film series by Warner Bros.
              Pictures. In 2016, the total value of the Harry Potter franchise
              was estimated at $25 billion,[7] making Harry Potter one of the
              highest-grossing media franchises of all time. Harry Potter and
              the Cursed Child is a play based on a story co-written by Rowling.
              The success of the books and films has allowed the Harry Potter
              franchise to expand with numerous derivative works, a travelling
              exhibition that premiered in Chicago in 2009, a studio tour in
              London that opened in 2012, a digital platform on which J. K.
              Rowling updates the series with new information and insight, and a
              pentalogy of spin-off films premiering in November 2016 with
              Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, among many other
              developments. Themed attractions, collectively known as The
              Wizarding World of Harry Potter, have been built at several
              Universal Parks & Resorts amusement parks around the world.</em

              >The Lord of the Rings is an epic[1] high-fantasy novel[a] by
              English author and scholar J. R. R. Tolkien. Set in Middle-earth,
              intended to be Earth at some time in the distant past, the story
              began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 children's book The Hobbit,
              but eventually developed into a much larger work. Written in
              stages between 1937 and 1949, The Lord of the Rings is one of the
              best-selling books ever written, with over 150 million copies
              sold.[2] The title refers to the story's main antagonist, the Dark
              Lord Sauron, who, in an earlier age, created the One Ring to rule
              the other Rings of Power given to Men, Dwarves, and Elves, in his
              campaign to conquer all of Middle-earth. From homely beginnings in
              the Shire, a hobbit land reminiscent of the English countryside,
              the story ranges across Middle-earth, following the quest to
              destroy the One Ring mainly through the eyes of the hobbits Frodo,
              Sam, Merry and Pippin. Although often called a trilogy, the work
              was intended by Tolkien to be one volume of a two-volume set along
              with The Silmarillion.[3][T 2] For economic reasons, The Lord of
              the Rings was published over the course of a year from 29 July
              1954 to 20 October 1955 in three volumes[3][4] titled The
              Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the
              King. The work is divided internally into six books, two per
              volume, with several appendices of background material. Some later
              editions print the entire work in a single volume, following the
              author's original intent. Tolkien's work, after an initially mixed
              reception by the literary establishment, has been the subject of
              extensive analysis of its themes and origins. Influences on this
              earlier work, and on the story of The Lord of the Rings, include
              philology, mythology, Christianity, earlier fantasy works, and his
              own experiences in the First World War. The Lord of the Rings has
              since been reprinted many times and translated into at least 38
              languages.[b] Its enduring popularity has led to numerous
              references in popular culture, the founding of many societies by
              fans of Tolkien's works,[5] and the publication of many books
              about Tolkien and his works. It has inspired many derivative
              works, including paintings, music, films, television, video games,
              and board games. It has helped to create and shape the modern
              fantasy genre, within which it is considered one of the greatest
              books of all time. Award-winning adaptations of The Lord of the
              Rings have been made for radio, theatre, and film. It has been
              named Britain's best-loved novel of all time in the BBC's 2003
              poll The Big Read.</em

              and seasoned with a quiet humor that is irresistible... All those,
              young or old, who love a fine adventurous tale, beautifully told,

              Review "In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit." So begins
              one of the most beloved and delightful tales in the English
              language—Tolkien's prelude to The Lord of the Rings. Set in the
              imaginary world of Middle-earth, at once a classic myth and a
              modern fairy tale, The Hobbit is one of literature's most enduring
              and well-loved novels. Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit who enjoys a
              comfortable, unambitious life, rarely traveling any farther than
              his pantry or cellar. But his contentment is disturbed when the
              wizard Gandalf and a company of dwarves arrive on his doorstep one
              day to whisk him away on an adventure. They have launched a plot
              to raid the treasure hoard guarded by Smaug the Magnificent, a
              large and very dangerous dragon. Bilbo reluctantly joins their
              quest, unaware that on his journey to the Lonely Mountain he will
              encounter both a magic ring and a frightening creature known as
              Gollum.</em

              fantasy world of magic, mythical beasts and talking animals. It
              narrates the adventures of various children who play central roles
              in the unfolding history of the Narnian world. Except in The Horse
              and His Boy, the protagonists are all children from the real world

              called upon by the lion Aslan to protect Narnia from evil. The

              is a book of the writings from the Dutch-language diary kept by
              Anne Frank while she was in hiding for two years with her family
              during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands. The family was
              apprehended in 1944, and Anne Frank died of typhus in the
              Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945. Anne's diaries were
              retrieved by Miep Gies and Bep Voskuijl. Miep gave them to Anne's
              father, Otto Frank, the family's only survivor, just after the
              Second World War was over. The diary has since been published in
              more than 70 languages. First published under the title Het
              Achterhuis. Dagboekbrieven 14 Juni 1942 – 1 Augustus 1944 (The
              Annex: Diary Notes 14 June 1942 – 1 August 1944) by Contact
              Publishing in Amsterdam in 1947, the diary received widespread
              critical and popular attention on the appearance of its English
              language translation, Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl by
              Doubleday & Company (United States) and Vallentine Mitchell
              (United Kingdom) in 1952. Its popularity inspired the 1955 play
              The Diary of Anne Frank by the screenwriters Frances Goodrich and
              Albert Hackett, which they adapted for the screen for the 1959
              movie version. The book is included in several lists of the top
              books of the 20th century.[1][2][3][4][5][6] The copyright of the
              Dutch version of the diary, published in 1947, expired on 1
              January 2016, seventy years after the author's death, as a result
              of a general rule in copyright law of the European Union.
              Following this, the original Dutch version was made available
              online.[7][8]</em

              >Animal Farm is a beast fable,[1] in the form of satirical
              allegorical novella, by George Orwell, first published in England
              on 17 August 1945.[2][3] It tells the story of a group of farm
              animals who rebel against their human farmer, hoping to create a
              society where the animals can be equal, free, and happy.
              Ultimately, the rebellion is betrayed, and the farm ends up in a
              state as bad as it was before, under the dictatorship of a pig
              named Napoleon. According to Orwell, Animal Farm reflects events
              leading up to the Russian Revolution of 1917 and then on into the
              Stalinist era of the Soviet Union.[1][4] Orwell, a democratic
              socialist,[5] was a critic of Joseph Stalin and hostile to
              Moscow-directed Stalinism, an attitude that was critically shaped
              by his experiences during the May Days conflicts between the POUM
              and Stalinist forces during the Spanish Civil War.[6][a] In a
              letter to Yvonne Davet, Orwell described Animal Farm as a
              satirical tale against Stalin ("un conte satirique contre
              Staline"),[7] and in his essay "Why I Write" (1946), wrote that
              Animal Farm was the first book in which he tried, with full
              consciousness of what he was doing, "to fuse political purpose and
              artistic purpose into one whole".[8]</em

              Dostoevsky. Dostoevsky spent nearly two years writing The Brothers
              Karamazov, which was published as a serial in The Russian
              Messenger from January 1879 to November 1880. Dostoevsky died less
              than four months after its publication. Set in 19th-century
              Russia, The Brothers Karamazov is a passionate philosophical novel
              that enters deeply into questions of God, free will, and morality.
              It is a theological drama dealing with problems of faith, doubt,
              and reason in the context of a modernizing Russia, with a plot
              that revolves around the subject of patricide. Dostoevsky composed
              much of the novel in Staraya Russa, which inspired the main
              setting.[1] It has been acclaimed as one of the supreme
              achievements in world literature.

              nəkɐˈzanʲɪje]) is a novel by the Russian author Fyodor Dostoevsky.
              It was first published in the literary journal The Russian
              Messenger in twelve monthly installments during 1866.[1] It was
              later published in a single volume. It is the second of
              Dostoevsky's full-length novels following his return from ten
              years of exile in Siberia. Crime and Punishment is considered the
              first great novel of his mature period of writing.[2] The novel is
              often cited as one of the supreme achievements in world
              literature.[3][4][5][6] Crime and Punishment follows the mental
              anguish and moral dilemmas of Rodion Raskolnikov, an impoverished
              ex-student in Saint Petersburg who plans to kill an unscrupulous
              pawnbroker, an old woman who stores money and valuable objects in
              her flat. He theorises that with the money he could liberate
              himself from poverty and go on to perform great deeds, and seeks
              to convince himself that certain crimes are justifiable if they
              are committed in order to remove obstacles to the higher goals of
              'extraordinary' men. Once the deed is done, however, he finds
              himself racked with confusion, paranoia, and disgust. His
              theoretical justifications lose all their power as he struggles
              with guilt and horror and confronts both the internal and external
              consequences of his deed.</em

              totalitarianism, mass surveillance and repressive regimentation of
              people and behaviours within society.[2][3] Orwell, a democratic
              socialist, modelled the authoritarian state in the novel on
              Stalinist Russia and Nazi Germany.[2][3][4] More broadly, the
              novel examines the role of truth and facts within societies and
              the ways in which they can be manipulated. The story takes place
              in an imagined future in the year 1984, when much of the world is
              in perpetual war. Great Britain, now known as Airstrip One, has
              become a province of the totalitarian superstate Oceania, which is
              led by Big Brother, a dictatorial leader supported by an intense
              cult of personality manufactured by the Party's Thought Police.
              Through the Ministry of Truth, the Party engages in omnipresent
              government surveillance, historical negationism, and constant
              propaganda to persecute individuality and independent thinking.[5]
              The protagonist, Winston Smith, is a diligent mid-level worker at
              the Ministry of Truth who secretly hates the Party and dreams of
              rebellion. He keeps a forbidden diary and begins a relationship
              with his colleague Julia, and they learn about a shadowy
              resistance group called the Brotherhood. However, their contact
              with the Brotherhood turns out to be a Party agent, and Smith is
              arrested. He is subjected to months of psychological manipulation
              and torture by the Ministry of Love and is released once he has
              come to love Big Brother. Nineteen Eighty-Four has become a
              classic literary example of political and dystopian fiction. It
              also popularised the term "Orwellian" as an adjective, with many
              terms used in the novel entering common usage, including "Big
              Brother", "doublethink", "Thought Police", "thoughtcrime",
              "Newspeak", and "2 + 2 = 5". Parallels have been drawn between the
              novel's subject matter and real life instances of totalitarianism,
              mass surveillance, and violations of freedom of expression among
              other themes.[6][7][8] Time included the novel on its list of the
              100 best English-language novels from 1923 to 2005,[9] and it was
              placed on the Modern Library's 100 Best Novels list, reaching
              number 13 on the editors' list and number 6 on the readers'
              list.[10] In 2003, it was listed at number eight on The Big Read
              survey by the BBC.</em
